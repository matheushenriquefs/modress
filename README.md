# Modress ðŸ‘¢

A lightweight modular CSS reset designed to support older browsers and seamlessly integrate with Web Components, eliminating code duplication. It's essentially a modularization of [ress](https://github.com/filipelinhares/ress) with some enhancements borrowed from [modern-normalize](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize). If you're initiating a new project that doesn't require legacy browser support or won't utilize Web Components, consider using [modern-normalize](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize).
